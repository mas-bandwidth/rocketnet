CONSTANT TraceLog

\* the log as a definition of no arguments, which TLC evaluates once when
\* it starts; every formula below reads Trace, never TraceLog. Read through
\* the substituted constant, TLC rebuilds the whole log at each access, and a
\* 3200-record trace takes 68 s instead of 3 s (bench-nyc-6, 2026-11-12)
Trace == TraceLog

\* checked once, when TLC starts
ASSUME /\ Len(TraceLog) >= 2
       /\ \A n \in DOMAIN TraceLog : DOMAIN TraceLog[n] = {"op", "act", "args", "state"}

VARIABLES ti,        \* the index of the record the state matches
          rejected   \* the record after ti is not a model step

\* every model variable by the field name the harness writes
VarsRec == [count |-> count, refused |-> refused]

\* the actions each operation of the code can be
OpActs == [claim |-> {"Claim", "Refuse"}, drain |-> {"Drain"}]

\* the action a record names, with the record's arguments; a name this CASE
\* lacks stops TLC with an error
Act(a, x) == CASE a = "Claim" -> Claim(x[1])
               [] a = "Refuse" -> Refuse(x[1])
               [] a = "Drain" -> Drain(x[1])

TraceInit ==
    /\ Init
    /\ ti = 1
    /\ rejected = (Trace[1].op # "init" \/ Trace[1].act # "init" \/ Trace[1].args # <<>>
                   \/ VarsRec # Trace[1].state)

TraceReject ==
    /\ ~rejected

    /\ rejected' = TRUE
    /\ UNCHANGED <<vars, ti>>

TraceDone ==
    /\ rejected \/ ti = Len(Trace)
    /\ UNCHANGED <<vars, ti, rejected>>

TraceSpec == TraceInit /\ [][TraceStep \/ TraceReject \/ TraceDone]_<<vars, ti, rejected>>

\* every record of the trace is the model step it names, from the one before
TraceConsistent == ~rejected

\* the row's reach predicate: some clean trace must take every place, the
\* edge where Claim turns to Refuse
